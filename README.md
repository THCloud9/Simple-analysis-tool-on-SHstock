# Simple-analysis-tool-on-SHstock
This is a simple tool to analysis the SHIndex.(actually a big lab which was done as homework)
You should notice that the data file hasn't been uploaded ^^
The important part of this tool is to analysis the beta of the stocks
Also you can calculate the beta of your own portfolio
Maybe in the future I will spend extra time on it.
